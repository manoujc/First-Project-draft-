# Project One First Draft

# For my project I decided to do two visuals for the rankings on famous Halloween candy in the United States. My first visual is a comparison between each candies sugar percent and each candies win percent. My second visual is a comparison between each candies average price and each candies win percent. In this visual the size of the points depends on whether there is caramel in it or not (0 = no, 1 = yes).

# The data I used is from data.fivethirtyeight.com.
